"""Benchmark environments for the EvoOntology evolution loop.

Each benchmark under this package is a self-contained environment that plugs
into the evolution loop through a single ``EvolutionAdapter`` (the EvoOntology
equivalent of SkillOpt's ``EnvAdapter``). See ``benchmarks/registry.py`` for the
discovery/registration layer and ``docs/guide/new-benchmark.md`` for the full
integration contract.
